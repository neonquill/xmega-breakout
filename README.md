A simple development board for *4 size Atmel AVR xmega processors.
Specifically developed for the ATxmega16d4.

Schematic and circuit board developed using the
[gEDA](http://www.gpleda.org/) suite, namely gschem and pcb.

## Open issues

 - The crystal on the first prototype board is significantly out of
   spec.  It's entirely possible it is a pcb layout problem.
